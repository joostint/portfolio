        <h4>Problem</h4>
          <h5>Students are not aware of or are not exploring campus buildings and resources that The Ohio State University has to offer. </h5>
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <h5>An app that utilizes the usersâ€™ location to display the progress of which buildings they have been to and enable students to join groups to promote campus-wide or private competition.</h5>
          <h3>By making the exploration experience a game, the app aims to increase students' engagement with campus facilities and to inspire competition. </h3>
        <h4>The Process</h4>
          <h5>I began by defining the features I wanted for the app. I knew I wanted a scrollable map, a friends page, a progress tracker. </h5>
          <h3>Then, I created digital wireframes of all the screens. I made sure to maintain the brand guidelines of the university. </h3>
          <img src="../assets/images/wanderlofi.png" class='round' />
          <h3>After this, I created a high fidelity wireframe. In this new version, I swapped out the settings page for a leaderboard to further promote competition and to retain a constant user base. </h3>

          <h3>You can view the AdobeXD design <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/518a1309-826c-4e2f-82ca-2a4d2ecde3c7-04d9/" class="link">here</a>.</h3>
          <h4>What I learned...</h4>
          <h5>I realized that sometimes you must be confident with your decisions. For example, I had visualized a circle progress bar for the progress screen, but ended up switching it a story progress report.</h5>
          <h3>Similarly, adding the leaderboard made the app have more functionalities and depth.</h3>
          <h3>Next time, I want to preform usability testing as this project had a deadline.</h3>
