          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <h5>
            Players are finding it hard to keep track of the score, leading to
            misunderstandings and potential disputes during the game.
          </h5>

          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <h5>
            A mobile app solution for players who struggle to keep track of
            scores during gameplay. The app would offer effortless scorekeeping
            functionalities, ensuring players never lose track of the score or
            forget a game.
          </h5>

          <h4>The Process</h4>
          <h5>
            Doing some market research, there were no other apps out there that
            had the same goals as our idea.
          </h5>
          <h3>
            I began with paper wireframes of my idea with basic screens and
            features, including swipe gestures, proportional scoring, and name
            changing.
          </h3>
          <img src="../assets/images/diewireframe.png" class="round" />
          <h3>Next, I began brainstorming potential logos and app names.</h3>
          <img src="../assets/images/logodraft.png" class="round" />
          <h3>
            I created a low fidelity wireframe in Figma based on the previous
            paper wireframe, establishing a basic layout.
          </h3>
          <img src="../assets/images/dielofi.png" class="round" />
          <h3>
            After some thought and discussions with the developer, I decided the
            name: Die Up! and created a logo in Adobe Illustrator.
          </h3>
          <img src="../assets/images/dielogo.png" class="round" />
          <h3>
            I got some feedback from users, such as getting rid of the account
            feature and adding a simpler home screen, and implemented their
            thoughts into the prototype. You can view the Figma design
            <a

              class="link"
              >here</a
            >.
          </h3>
          <img src="../assets/images/diehifi.png" class="round" />
          <h3>
            After conducting some user interviews with the interactive
            prototype, we added help text via an information icon to guide the
            user and prevent errors. This was to address users that struggled
            with the swipe gesture on the home page.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            We are currently working on final touches, addressing accessibility
            guidelines, and a terms and services page before submitting an
            application for the App Store.
          </h3>

          <h4>What I learned...</h4>
          <h5>
            App development is not a simple, linear process. There are times
            where you must scrap an idea or even start over. This is all apart
            of the design process.
          </h5>
          <h3>
            Additionally, it was difficult to work on this project as both of us
            were attending school. This made communication about how my designs
            transfer over to code limited.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Next time I design an app, I would like to do more user testing via
            interviews or surveys, as it can provide many insights that the
            designer or developer can see while creating an app.
